Question,Answer
"What is Python Friday?","Python Friday is a weekly blog series created by Johnny Graber — an ongoing lab journal of hands‑on Python experiments, mini‑tutorials, and code snippets on practical topics and tools."
"Who writes it, and why did it start?","Johnny Graber began posting weekly in early 2020 (on his original blog Improve & Repeat), then moved the series to its own site when it surpassed 250 episodes — driven by a goal to learn something new each Friday."
"How often are new blog posts published?","New posts are published roughly once every Friday (i.e. one new Python Friday post per workweek), with occasional skips around public holidays."
"What topics does Python Friday cover?","The blog spans a wide spectrum: categories include AI, API, analytics, async, testing, web, data‐visualisation, development, security, and more — covering libraries like Flask, FastAPI, pandas, pytest, Docker, and LLMs."
"How are topics organized on the site?","Each post is tagged with specific keywords (e.g. flask, docker, pandas) and categorized under broader buckets like web, testing, AI, analytics, and async, helping readers filter by interest."
"Is Python Friday suitable for beginners or more advanced users?","It’s aimed at both: some ‘basics’ and education posts walk through fundamentals, while other posts use advanced features like async, Docker, testing frameworks, database persistence, and LLM integrations."
"Does it include tutorials and code examples?","Yes — there’s a GitHub repo with code examples for many posts, and each article often includes working snippets, demos, and guided projects (e.g. a Flask or FastAPI API, or Docker container)."
"Does it cover modern Python tools like Docker, pytest, and LLMs?","Definitely—recent posts explore using Docker containers, writing automated tests with pytest, async programming, and even integrating small LLMs or APIs, under relevant tags like API, testing, and AI."
"How can I browse posts by topic?","You can use the Tags page to filter posts by library or feature (e.g. flask, pandas, pytest) or browse the main categories list via the site’s sidebar/nav menu."
"Can readers suggest topics or participate?","Yes — the author asked readers for future topic suggestions in the #52 retrospective post (“What topics interest you?”), and the site offers links to contact the author."
