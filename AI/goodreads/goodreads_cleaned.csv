"=""""","Origin (Robert Langdon, #5)","Durchgang Nr.5 mit Robert Langdon und die 7. Ausgabe der Schnitzeljagt die man aus den bisherigen Büchern von Dan Brown kennt. Diesmal muss in Spanien ein Video mit einer weltbewegenden Ankündigung gefunden werden, während ein Geheimbund dies zu verhindern versucht.<br/><br/>Das positive vorab: Wenn man das Buch zügig liest und die bekannten Wechsel der Erzählstränge mag, bekommt man eine spannende Geschichte vorgesetzt, die sich diesmal um künstliche Intelligenz und den Ursprung des Lebens dreht. Man darf nun nicht anfangen die Geschichte zu hinterfragen oder sich zu viele Gedanken über das gelesene zu machen. Sonst wird es leider sehr schnell sehr wirr (auf einem Level wie dem Film Prometheus – Dunkle Zeichen, dem Vorgänger von Alien).<br/><br/>Diesmal darf Ambra Vidal neben Robert Langdon miträtseln, oder besser gesagt bei der kommenden Verfilmung als Empfängerin der Monologe von Robert dienen – Dan Brown ignoriert den immer wieder gepredigten Ansatz «Show don’t tell» ja auch in diesem Buch konsequent. Zur Handlung trägt Ambra nahezu nichts bei, abgesehen von der Aufforderung zum finden des Videos, dem Autopiloten im Tesla und der Banalität, dass man bei einem aufgeschlagenen Buch nicht nur eine, sondern 2 Seiten sieht. Ambra Vidal benötigt es allerdings für den ganzen Handlungsstrang mit dem spanischen Königshaus. Ohne diesen Teil wäre das Buch nach einem Drittel fertig und man würde sich viele Fragen über die einmal mehr äusserst flachen Charaktere ersparen.<br/><br/>Beim vorgehenden Teil Inferno bleibt am Ende des Buches das etische Dilemma: Wenn Überbevölkerung ein solch grosses Problem ist und man einen Virus hat mit dem man dies lösen könnte, wäre man bereit diesen Virus zu nutzen um die Menschheit zu retten? <br/><br/>Bei Origin stellt sich eine ganz andere Frage: War Dan Brown gleich erleichtert als er das Manuskript fertig hatte wie ich als Leser am Ende des Buches? An Fantasielosigkeit ist dieses Buch ja schwer zu unterbieten. Man nehme 2001 A Space Odyssey (Ursprung des Lebens und Computer tötet Mensch), Siri als zeitgemässer Ersatz von HAL sowie dessen «Vater» Steve Jobs (stirbt vorzeitig an Pankreas-Krebs) und füge noch die eine oder andere Verschwörungstheorie und Social Media hinzu und fertig sind alle Teile von Origin. <br/>Da zudem am Ende eine spektakuläre Überraschung ausbleibt, ist dies aus meiner Sicht das bislang schlechteste Buch von Dan Brown.",1

Not only do they change in the order with each chapter (one it is JavaScript, Go, Python, then it is Python, Go, JavaScript) but you also need to read all 3 languages to not miss anything important. However, even with chapters dedicated to only one language, the author misses the chance to explain the programming-language specific tooling that could help you with TDD. <br/><br/>Unless you try to learn Go, JavaScript, and Python at the same time you try to learn TDD, this book will be no use to you.<br/>",1

TDD alone would fill a book and DDD is an even bigger topic. Unfortunately for the readers, we get from both parts a bit and from nothing enough to be useful.<br/><br/>The author loves abbreviations and acronyms, explaining them is not his strength. If you find yourself in front of an abbreviation that you have no clue about, keep reading. To get the definition of WFA you may need to read up to chapter 6, even when you start building it in chapter 3. The explanation for the prefix Uqs in the project names follows in chapter 7. Such things should be found by a copy-editor and get fixed before the book gets published.<br/><br/>The FAQ section for TDD is useless. Is there a difference between Agile Scrum and Scrum, Agile Kanban and Kanban or Agile XP and XP? Prefixing everything with Agile when you write about agile methodologies is pointless. The other answers are not better and will not tell you anything if you did not already have prior knowledge.<br/><br/>Sintegration tests is a term I never heard before. It has nothing to do with the company of the same name and after reading the book, it looks for me it is just a unit test for a bigger unit. Why the author needed a new name for what was known as outside-in-testing remains unknown.<br/><br/>One of the main problems of the book is that the author wants to cover too much in a chapter. The best example for that is the chapter on FIRSTHAND, where he writes about naming conventions, code coverage, extensions for Visual Studio, test frameworks, practices, offers a solution to freeze time and many, many more things. Other authors use FAST to define the important aspects of TDD tests and give the readers a chance to remember what the F stands for when they get to the T. <br/><br/>The DDD adventure starts in part 2. The explanation of DDD is shallow, uses the same example of a 5£ note everyone else does and fails to understand that the ubiquitous language is much more than the business language. The code examples end up with the usual mix of domain terms followed by a *Service or *Repository suffix and are full of primitive data types – as if the string and the int are the pinnacles of the ubiquitous language. <br/><br/>The applications that the author builds with DDD either have no tests (as in chapter 7) or the testing starts when there is already a lot of code around (chapter 8, 9 and 10). There would be challenging aspects in the user stories he picks, but the implementation with TDD always stops right before it gets interesting. Some of those challenges would show why it is a bad idea to use the discouraged Entity Framework In-Memory provider.<br/><br/>After many more repetitions that this book is only about testing the backend, we finally reach part 3. The chapter on GitHub Actions is not bad, even when it takes too much space in a book on TDD. The excursion into brownfield projects was the most useless part of the whole book. Nice diagrams show the questions you should ask, but if you look closer, you only get the consultants favourite answer of “it depends”. All that interweaved with the strawman argument that you cannot introduce unit testing because you have no safety net to make changes (then how do you keep changing the application to introduce new features?). The final chapter on the rollout of TDD had some good insights, but it came too late to save the book.<br/><br/>If you are interested in TDD, buy any other book on TDD. <br/><br/>",1

The Mikado method does not try to replace refactoring, it gives you a tool to navigate the many additional changes you need to do to introduce that complex change in your system that does not fit in easily. With its 4 steps (set a goal, experiment, visualize and undo) you can minimize the mental load of that complex change and focus on finding all the dependencies that you need to do before you can make your change. <br/><br/>The biggest challenge you may have with this method is the undo step. What looks like loosing your work is in fact a productivity boost. Never again will you need to keep changing part after part to get back to a state where your software works. You try to make a change and if it does not work, you revert. But before you throw your changes away, you write down what you need to change to make this current change possible. You repeat that until you no longer run into obstacles and you can do the change without reverting it. From that point on you have uncovered all the hidden dependencies and you can start making the changes in the reverse order of their discovery. Instead of that enormous change you only make small, independent refactorings that are fast and without risk. You will be much faster than the other way around even when you need to revert a lot of times to create that map. <br/><br/>Sometimes great productivity boost come from simple adaptions of your workflow.

It seems that every (re-) discovery the software development industry made in the last 20 years went unnoticed to the author. Continuous Integration? No need to do more than a smoke test for the integration once per day. Continuous Delivery? No need, then you only get features at the end of the project. A holistic approach to solving problems? Yes, but the architect is holistic enough – the team is just a resource that can be added or removed as you need. Fast feedback cycles? No need, the architect has everything planned and sliced the work to create the dependency graph that you as developer just need to follow. <br/><br/>Most/All design happens upfront, then build the software and test at the end - that sounds a lot like a waterfall to me. The author calls his method The Method, what is an early example on how he will use names of concepts throughout the book: When a concept has a name, the author will not bother to use it. <br/><br/>The unique selling point of this book is the decomposition of the project by volatility. Functional decomposition is evil, only splitting around volatility will help you to create a successful project (change the name and you are back at the old concept of Stable Dependencies Principle - A package should only depend upon packages that are more stable than it is). While many paragraphs where spend on why functional decomposition is bad and using volatility is so much better, software related examples on how to do that are missing. You get examples about furniture and buildings, but the concrete examples for software did not make it into the book. Given the importance this topic has for this book (everything else is built on this decomposition), I cannot see how anyone will be able to put The Method into action. If we ignore that part, we are left with Use Cases containing activity diagrams and a multi-layered architecture – for that I do not need to buy this book.<br/>",1

I have yet to try those ideas with my data, but it addresses many of my concerns I have with other approaches. <br/><br/>The main point of a forecast is that we have to update it as the project goes along. Like in the example of the path of a Hurricane and the updates of the forecasted path that happens every 8 hours by the Hurricane Center. Only when we are able to update our forecasts do they stay relevant. Otherwise they are useless and only prevent us from doing the work to finish the project.<br/><br/>The author wrote another book on this topic (Actionable Agile Metrics for Predictability) where he explained all the theory behind his claims. For me, that book was too often referenced and after the 5x time it was just disappointed that he did not add an excerpt of the main points as an appendix to this book.

First published in 1911, this book shows us a world that has absolutely no compassion for workers and their rights. Stupid muscle is what you need, and that is what you get – not humans. If you can bare that zeitgeist, you get an interesting read. Most fascinating for me is how much of his ideas are ignored by the very same people constantly referring to his principles. <br/><br/>Taylor explains in his book how you can improve productivity when every single part of work is done in a way that improves the overall productivity, not the most efficient processing of that single task. He explains this with moving iron ore around and the necessary breaks that need to go along. Without them, the men get overworked too fast and the overall productivity sinks. (Compare that with all the micro-optimisations in our time and how everyone ignores the overall productivity)<br/><br/>If you want your workers to do more work, you need to let them participate in the gains of their productivity. In short: pay them more! He explains in detail how much more that should be and shows that above that income the prospect of making more money is no longer a motivation. His example for this point are the workers who go to another steel factory with the promise of higher payment but return because the organisation has not done their homework and the workers earn substantially less. (individual bonus systems for things you only can achieve as a team)<br/><br/>There are many more examples on how his scientific method works that are by now completely forgotten. What was saved into our times is the exact measurement of every single task we do. Combine that with a wrongly understood concept of productivity and we end up exactly where we are.

Having a plan that can scale up and down as you need it sounds great. But it did not increase my confidence in this blueprint when the author feels the need to write down that this really works. I therefore cannot recommend this book. ",2
"=""9780131857254""","Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#","One of the biggest disappointments of all the books I read this year. The scope is far too big to cover it in one single book and it therefore lacks the pages to explain the many concepts it introduces. If you know those concepts before, then this is not a problem. But then again, why do you read this book? <br/><br/>The structure is no help either. The section 4 (Packaging the Payroll System) explains what you have to consider for package and component design (as you expect), but then goes on to explain patterns like Visitor, Adapter/Bridge and ends up with the database and Model View Presenter. Such a structure makes it extremely hard to find a specific topic – you more or less need to scan the whole chapter list to find the right place.<br/><br/>The bibliography is for once at the end of every chapter. While I liked that when reading the book for the first time, I hated it as soon as I had to check something. There are 30 places to look up – no problem with an eBook, but unfortunately, I have the print edition… <br/><br/>The book contains an enormous amount of code examples. Unfortunately again, one sees that they are translated from the previous edition of this book that uses Java. This means no C# specific code syntax and therefore not much that justifies the C# in the title. Especially since it ignores the generics, that would made examples like the BubbleSorter much simpler. <br/><br/>I think the topics this book covers are very important. But the way they are covered in this book makes it unnecessary hard to follow along. Instead of this book, you should get a book for each main part and not try to cover all with this one here. ",1

However, this book here lacks the practical, hands-on advice you get with the other two books. Clean Architecture talks a lot about SOLID and decoupling. Part 5 (Architecture), on the other hand, is a rather muddled collection of shallow concepts that lack the necessary details to be helpful. Great, there is a box and an arrow and a red line – but what does that mean? How do you make those boundaries? What should you consider? This book lacks all those basic parts that every other book on architecture offers - and not in a good way where you replace the parts that everyone knows with new and unique content. This book lets you guess what those images should mean and offers no help to apply those techniques with your own code.<br/><br/>To prove the importance of good software design we find a case study in chapter 1. If you only skim over, then everything looks sound and supportive of the claims made by Martin. However, as soon as you look a little bit closer, the whole study falls apart. There are 6 graphs to illustrate the findings of a study. Only 2 graphs bother with labelling both axes. If you look even closer, only 5 graphs are about that “study” and they tell a rather different story than what Martin makes out of it. The last graph is the best. It is about a small experiment solving the Roman Numerals Kata and measuring the time it took Jason Groman to complete it (3x with TDD, 3x without TDD). This graph cuts off 75% of the values (by starting at 22 minutes instead of 0), what turns the difference in speed from 10% to something that looks like a 50% time saving. Using tricks like this one to prove that TDD is such a great time saver is a disappointment, especially since Martin is such a vocal proponent for TDD. Is that all he has to prove his approach? <br/><br/><p>Another great example of the problems with this book is chapter 30 (the database is a detail). He throws in a bold claim and spend the next paragraph to explain that this can be misinterpreted and that he only talks about the technology and not the data model. Instead of explaining that, he could have written what he meant in the first paragraph. The rest of this chapter is a rather generic and short explanation on why one needs databases in the first place. Nothing new, nothing helpful in any form from an architectural perspective and again so shallow that you can’t learn anything from it. </p><br/><br/>For me this book is an absolute disappointment and the worst one on architecture I ever read. <br/>",1

It keeps going on to various examples of problems and how one can solve them. Generally, not a bad approach, but with this title one can assume the readers know what Microservices are and want to create them. Without an easy to spot structure in explaining the different patterns, one has to read the whole chapter to even find the important differences. That’s when the writing style kicks in and makes that experience dreadful. Whole paragraphs about what he is going to explain, not just at the beginning of a chapter, but again and again in the middle of an example. Explaining many of the patterns using the frameworks created by the author does not improve the book, it makes it a lot less useful. <br/>",1

Instead of doing all things at once, focus on one single project and finish it. Instead of working 80 or 100 hours work 40 and have enough energy to do the work and find time to sleep. </p><br/><br/>The chapters are just a few pages and can be read in any order you like. I especially liked the idea of the two tokens for handling problems (end of world, no problem at all) and the idea that Yes is a promise while No keeps your options open.

Wrox Professional guides are written to meet the real-world needs of programmer, at least this is what the advertisement says. Unfortunately the book spends the first 7 chapters with explaining the basic parts of MVC. The authors are too far away from those who need those introduction to really address their problems. <br/><br/>The following chapters are not bad, but the one on NuGet explains the problem of the book well: NuGet is a great help to get the required packages. That is explained in much detail and even more is written about creating your own NuGet packages. What is missing is how that packaging process can be integrated in the workflow of creating an ASP.Net MVC 5 application. When should I make my NuGet package? What is the benefit and do I really need it? All those questions are unanswered.<br/> <br/>The chapter on unit testing is another good example of the problems: The authors point out that the important benefit of TDD is not so much the testing aspect as it is about designing the application. But what follows is another explanation of how to test the application – designing it is never mentioned again. Another lost opportunity.<br/><br/>The real world application in chapter 17 was what I hoped to find all over the book: Good advice from experts on how they solve problems in the context of MVC 5. There they introduce many tools that would deserve far more space and could make a real difference. But that chapter is over after just 24 pages of that 560 pages book.

Understanding the why and the how of a task in the big picture is essential to stop those many problems that constantly interrupt development. The book offers a simple way to align IT with the business and shows what all needs to change to make it work. The 3 principles of flow are easy to understand, but as the book shows, there is a lot going on in a company that tries to undermine every effort to improve. And that is the hard part. You can’t just read the book, put people in a room and add some Kanban boards. It’s hard work that can have an enormous payback, but only when the C-level understands what goes on and what needs to be done.

"=""""",Secure by Design,"There are some great ideas right at the beginning of the book. Don’t try to add security as a feature, instead put it in the design. Don’t use the basic data types like string, int and float for concepts that have important business rules attached. <br/>The example with a negative quantity in a shopping bag shows this well: Using an int offers the possibility to use a negative number. What happens if you order -1 book? In his example the book store tried to send a check to get even with the customer. It was a tester who found it, but many of the customers figured out an even less suspicious way: Oder negative amounts of books to get a discount on a regular order. <br/>If you use a class to represent quantity that doesn’t allow nulls or int.MaxValue, you can control the rules and got many security constraints build in – without the need to add them later or to force developers to jump through hoops. <br/><br/>With such a great start I hoped the rest of the book would continue on this level. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Many wordy chapters followed, including one that tried to explain DDD – in a way that even I who know a lot about it had a hard time to follow. That was not the only topic where I got this experience. Instead of making things more understandable I often wondered if the authors tried to make it as complex as possible.

"=""9781501143311""",Bullshit Jobs: A Theory,"A great book that explains what bullshit jobs are and how they influence our world with scientific effort. It is based on the essay “Bullshit Jobs” by Graeber himself and the reactions it provoked. Jobs that have no meaning and no effect would not be our problem – the company that offers them is obviously aware of the uselessness and decided nonetheless to spend money on them. However, the story does not end there. Those jobs have a negative impact on the people doing them. Moreover, it has an impact on the jobs that are needed and valuable. Those jobs have additional work because those bullshit jobs come up with forms and ideas that need to be filled by someone who does important work.<br/><br/>While the book does not suggest a basic income, it shows how much financial “space” there is to support jobs that no one needs and have no positive impact on the business. If there is enough money for that, it will be enough money to make something useful. The book shows as well that there is enough creativity to create jobs that are not needed, the challenges created by AI and automation should therefore be manageable. <br/><br/>Favourite quote: Some programmers come with t-shirts to work that say “don’t annoy me or I replace you with a small script”.<br/>",5

"=""""","The Imposter's Handbook (Imposter's Handbook, #1)","I deeply respect the courage Rob showed by writing a book on topics he is still learning. This book shows us that even a Rob Conery doesn’t get everything right the first time and that we mere mortal developers are not alone with our struggles to understand complex topics. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the book isn’t advertised as this ongoing learning experience. Instead, it is marketed as a book to learn the fundamental concepts and skills that come with a degree in Computer Science. That is simply not what this book is about. In the middle of the book, Rob replaces this goal with all the things you should know to be a good programmer and only he knows how the last part on Unix tools fits in. <br/><br/>The book has great chapters where the talent of Rob shines. I enjoyed the explanation and comparison of the Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra algorithms to find the shortest path in a graph. His explanations combined with the illustrations made it super-simple to follow along and to understand the ideas. The same is true for the chapter on databases. However, there you can already spot the problem: So many topics are started but can’t be covered beyond a simple description: DataMart, Data Warehouse, Cube, Snowflake and many more. Are a few paragraphs per term enough to have an intelligent conversation about it? I don’t think so, but that should be the point of the book (according to the preface in the version I read). <br/><br/>The chapter on TDD is a poster example for this book: It is a well-written explanation on how TDD works and how it could guide the design of your application. Then it stops. All you get is the essence of the idea, nothing more. Why should you use TDD? What are the benefits? What could be a problem? You are left to figure it out on your own; again. All we get in the book is that it is controversial, most of the people Rob has asked don’t strictly do TDD and Rob needs to delete less code when he uses it. Really?<br/><br/>The missing Index at the end of the book is just another problem, but one that could be fixed without much effort. Without the Index, you need to search the whole book for a concept. The same problem is the missing changelog. A living book that is intended to change should at least have a list of those changes. <br/><br/>All in all, I’m disappointed and fear this book has a long way to go until it reaches the quality level we expect from a Rob Conery. Maybe the next iterations will get us there.<br/>",2

Im Buch von Robert Maurer geht es um Kaizen, die von den Japanern optimierte Methode um in kleinen Schritten grosse Verbesserungen herbeizuführen. Den meisten ist dies wohl durch den Autobauer Toyota bekannt, der mittels Kaizen in wenigen Jahren zu einem Weltkonzern aufgestiegen ist.</p><br/><br/>Auch für den Alltag empfiehlt es sich grössere Vorhaben die viel Zeit beanspruchen mit ganz kleinen Schritten zu starten - vor allem wenn man das eigene Verhalten verbessern will. Zu Beginn neuer Abenteuer und Herausforderungen sind fast alle sehr motiviert. Wenn aber die ersten Rückschläge kommen braucht es Ausdauer und eine Routine, die sich nur Schritt für Schritt aufbauen lässt. Dieses Buch zeigt einem viele Tipps wie man dies in die Tat umsetzen kann, ohne allerdings auf die einzelnen Ziele stark einzugehen. Hierbei gilt ganz klar dass der Weg das Ziel ist. Kaizen ist eine Möglichkeit für nachhaltige Veränderungen die oft – aber wie von Maurer richtig bemerkt – nicht immer und überall hilft. Wo Kaizen aber anwendbar ist sollte man mindestens einmal den Versuch wagen – bei den kleinen Schritten verliert man im schlechtesten Fall einige Minuten pro Tag, gewinnt im besten Fall aber eine nachhaltige Verbesserung die man nicht so leicht wieder her gibt.<br/>",5

Great ideas never see the light of day because the inner critic voiced “this is not good enough” or “everyone knows that”. <br/><br/><p>Denise Jacobs explains in this book how bad those self-doubts really are. There are many personal stories of Denise that make clear that you are not alone with your inner critic. But even better, she gives simple and easy-to-follow advice to overcome the inner critic. I liked the simple gesture of delete (a swipe of your hand from right to left) to get rid of the points brought up by my inner critic. It’s so simple that it may look ridiculous. But the combination of thought and a gesture is powerful and helps to reinforce the message. <br/><br/>Another simple technique helps to focus on the whole and not only on a tiny little negative part. When negative thoughts pop up you add “and then I did …”. An example: if you had a presentation in front of 10 people and one person was disappointed, you can focus on that person. Or you could focus on the 9 others that enjoyed the talk. Whenever the thought of this one negative person comes up, you can start overwriting that thought with “and then the 9 other people told me how much they liked my talk”. Not to loop endlessly in those negative thoughts gives you power to create something new. </p><br/><br/>The book offers many more techniques and if one gives it a try, then there should be something for everyone.

Auf der Hauptbühne läuft das Stück «Meetings und Berichte», während auf der Hinterbühne die richtige Arbeit an allen Anweisungen und Prozessen vorbei erledigt wird. Rechnet man diese Leerläufe nur für eine Firma hoch, so wird einem schlecht. Was das für die ganze Wirtschaft bedeutet mag man sich gar nicht ausrechnen. <br/><br/>Das Buch gibt einem aber auch Hoffnung. Die Situation muss nicht so sein und es gibt Wege aus diesem Theater. Allerdings sind einfache Lösungen hier fehl am Platz. Nur weil Firma X mit Methode Y Erfolg hatte, muss dies für die eigene Firma nicht zutreffen. Viel wichtiger ist es zu prüfen, was genau brauchen wir und dies dann umzusetzen. Nur bedeutet dies Veränderung, und die wird wie von Vollmer korrekt beschrieben, vor allem auf Ablehnung stossen. <br/><br/>Sehr gut hat mir die Beschreibung der Generation Y gefallen. Hier kommt nicht das immer wiederkehrende ""<i>die wollen halt nicht arbeiten</i>"", sondern zeigt das diese Generation schlicht kein Interesse an diesem Theater hat. Die Generation Y will arbeiten, aber nicht Arbeit spielen. Wer als Firma nur einen Theatersaal anbieten kann, muss sich daher auch nicht wundern, wenn diese Talente zur Konkurrenz gehen.<br/><br/>Das Buch enthält aber auch einen sehr guten Hinweis für die Arbeiter. Wo Arbeit nur gespielt wird, muss man sich dessen bewusst sein. Hier zählt nicht die wirkliche Arbeit, sondern dass man gut mitspielt.

The idea of impact maps is a good one and could help you to save a lot of time and money. Therefore I hope someone will publish a follow up with all the things you have to look out. It definitely would help many projects, not only those who produce software.<br/>",4
"=""""",The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,"The Lean Startup by Eric Ries shows how you can apply the ideas of Lean Management/Production (especially reducing waste) to companies. It’s not only applicable for startups, but can be used in established companies as well. Whatever you do you can use this book to question your assumptions and try to validate them.<br/><p> <br/>For me the part of validating is greatly explained by Ries. Having a software development background the Lean Startup connects easily with practices like TDD (test-driven development). Here you test big and important things and not just a tiny piece of code. Otherwise the same restrictions and traps await you, which mean you already have ways to deal with them. <br/></p><br/><p><br/>Ries uses a mix of own anecdotes and his theories with success stories and failures from other companies. As he writes early on it’s always simpler to argue for your methods when they’re successful. It’s much harder to detect what is successful while you are doing it. If it’s really science or an art I can’t definitely say. So far Ries does not deliver enough prove for a ruling. But as the movement grows the necessary data will appear and we can judge later. <br><br/>Until then read the book, try to validate your assumptions and be willing to pivot when Ries ideas don’t work out. </p><br/>",4

We can follow Katniss Everdeen who took the place of her sister into the arena where the killing begins and many hard decisions need to be made to survive the games.</p><br/><br/><p>Catching Fire shows us that surviving the games was not enough to get out alive. The districts are in uproar and as a special punishment the tributes for the Quarter Quell are selected from the pool of victors. By being the only female victor it’s clear at the announcement of this change of rules means Katniss is going back to the arena – this time an even deadlier place than ever before.</p><br/><br/><p>Mockingjay shows us that nothing will be as it was and that winning the Hunger Games never brought relieve to the victors. And we have to learn that psychical terror creates wounds that go down to the core of what we are. The girl is gone and an empty shell tries to go through the days – until a mission arise to go to the capitol and end it for good.</p><br/><br/><p>The first book Hunger Games is a great story and brings the character of Katniss to life. The second book Catching Fire only shows how deep the cracks in the facade of the capitol go and otherwise only fills the time between the first and the third book. The third book Mockingjay however is a brilliant piece of writing. We can follow how more and more of the vitality goes out of Katniss, how it’s restored only a little bit before the next blow hits. The writing changes from show to tell and affirms the story by removing more and more of the main character. <br><br/>All that only to hit us all with surprise when the last bit of fire ignites and Katniss kills the other president. The epilogue is a good reminder that certain wounds not even time can fully heal – a fitting end to the story of Katniss Everdeen and the tributes of Panem (from the Latin phrase ""Panem et Circenses"").</p><br/><br/><br/>",5

At the end you find so many different approaches that many of them exclude themselves. You either are an intrapreneur or in a startup, but not both at the same time.<br/>Part one and the first few chapters in part two are really good. They show important aspects, they explain what you can do to transform your hunch to (dis-)proven facts and why you should care. If the book only would contain that it would deserve a 5 start rating.<br/><br/><p><br/>Unfortunately the book keeps going on and tries to include everyone and everything. As if the authors have forgotten what they wanted from you as a reader: Find your customers and build a great product.</p><p><br/>Part three starts good but losses focus when they try to explain again for every business its specific lines in the sand. Skipping some chapters for other business models is not an option. Commonly usable methods are explained only once and if you skip exactly that chapter you can go back and try to find out where the authors took the time to explain things like the smile graph or the sessions-to-clicks ratio.<br/></p><br/>I hope the authors read the first part of their book, make some experiments and then cut it in half for the next edition.

They get send to an island far away and no one ever talks about them. <br/><br/><p>The best description in how both books differ comes from Neil Postman: <br><br/>What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information.

Another big plus in this book is the explanation on how to test your application.

If you do this as a team effort or with a dedicated role for architecture may vary by project. For both ways you find guidance in this book.<br/><br/>As Simon Brown explains this doesn’t mean you need to go back to big upfront planning. Architecture and agile projects are not a contradiction and can work together.

"=""9780735680944""",Programming Microsoft ASP.NET MVC,"The 3th edition of „Programming Microsoft ASP.NET MVC“ by Dino Esposito is a book that left me puzzled. When you read this book you will not believe that only one single author wrote it. I understand that it is not as easy as it looks to write a book. And I can live with chapters that are not as well written as others. But the differences in the chapter of this book are unseen.<br/> <br/>The first part has no obvious structure and jumps from topic to topic. I often had to go back and reread the sub-sub-sub heading to find out how we ended up in the implementation details of the view engine Razor when a page earlier Esposito explained the deep inner working of his self-made routing class. <br/><br/>Part 2 however is completely different. Here Esposito explains the topics in great depth and the book gets extremely helpful. No jumps, a lot of information you nowhere else find and all that is very well written. Would every chapter be as good as Web API this would be a clear 6-Star book. <br/><br/>In Part 3 we find a mix from both. I can’t believe that a reader new to JavaScript will understand the chapter Effective JavaScript. And since it only covers the basics you can skip it as well when you know JavaScript. Building sites for multiple devices sounds interesting but fails to cover all the technologies and frameworks Esposito packed in. Without space to explain them you only get a glimpse and know at the end not much more than the name and what the framework may be used for.<br/><br/>Without a complete example and only showing a few lines of code in each time you need to know ASP.NET MVC in depth to follow. I don’t know why you have to explain to that audience that ASP.NET MVC is different to Web Forms over and over again. The same goes for all the explanation on how you could write your application in MVC as you did it in Web Forms. <br/><br/>Dino Esposito has a thoroughly understanding of ASP.NET MVC and when he writes it down as in part 2 it would be a great book. I can’t imagine what happened to part 1 and expect the presence of part 3 as necessary to get a book with more than 500 pages. Considering all this and its price I can’t recommend the 3th edition.
